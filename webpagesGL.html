    <p>Hello! My name is Jimmy-Lee Brown, and I am a current student at NC State University. 
    I was born in France, and lived there until 2012, when I moved to Greensboro, North Carolina. 
    I am hoping to earn my masters degree in aerospace engineering. 
    Outside of school, I enjoy all things related to food, music, and cars.
